# 🏛️ Museum App – UI/UX Design by Giannis

Welcome to my design-focused fork of the **Museum App**, a mobile application created as part of a **university project**. The app offers an educational and immersive experience, allowing users to explore animals, dinosaurs, planets, and sculptures through rich visuals and engaging content.

While the application was developed in Flutter by **Rafail**, my role in this project was dedicated entirely to the **user interface and experience design**.

- Creating **high-fidelity mockups** for all key screens and interactions.
- Developing a **component-based design system** for consistency and developer handoff.
- Ensuring the app is **accessible, mobile-friendly**, and visually engaging.
- Collaborating closely with the developer to ensure the **final product reflected the original design vision**.
